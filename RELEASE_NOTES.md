Changes for this version of DIPLOMAT:
 - Fixed installation process for DIPLOMAT with SLEAP on windows by adding keras dependency.
 - Added support for changing some UI appearance settings to DIPLOMAT's supervised and tweak UI.
 - Make SLEAP frontend error out unless a user explicitly passes a number of outputs parameter.
 - Improved point rendering in the UI (proper alpha transparency support and smoother point rendering).
