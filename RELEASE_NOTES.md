Changes for this version of DIPLOMAT:
- "track" and "track_with" will now output .dipui files again
- removed boilerplate implementation of --dipui_file in lieu of dynamic system that reconciles command line arguments with plugin and frontend arguments
- removed debugging statements
- patched a bug that caused a crash when a specified .dipui file name already exists
