# Release Instructions

**REPLACE:** How does one generate a new release of the software? Ideally, this
should be an automated process, but there may still be a handful of steps. It is
also good to describe, at a high level, what the release script does. For
example, create a Git tag, increment the version number in a particular file,
create a release on GitHub, and so on.
